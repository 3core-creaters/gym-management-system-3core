            <h2 class="text-3xl font-extrabold text-center text-gray-800 mb-6">What is Core and Flexibility Training?</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Core and flexibility training are two essential components of a well-rounded fitness routine. Core training focuses
                on strengthening the muscles of the abdomen, lower back, and pelvis, which are crucial for overall stability and
                balance. Flexibility training, on the other hand, helps to improve the range of motion in your muscles and joints,
                reducing the risk of injury and improving overall movement efficiency.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Together, core and flexibility training enhance functional strength, posture, and flexibility, benefiting both
                athletes and individuals looking to improve their daily physical performance.

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                For optimal results, it's essential to incorporate core and flexibility exercises into your fitness routine. These
                exercises can be performed daily or 3-4 times per week. Combine them with strength training, cardiovascular
                exercises, and other forms of fitness to build a well-rounded program.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Consider integrating core exercises at the beginning of your workout to activate the muscles, and use flexibility
                exercises after your workout to cool down and improve muscle recovery. Consistency is key to achieving lasting
                improvements in core strength and flexibility.
