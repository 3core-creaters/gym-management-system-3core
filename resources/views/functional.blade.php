            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Functional training is a type of exercise that prepares the body for real-life movements by training muscles to work together.
                Unlike traditional exercises that isolate specific muscles, functional training uses exercises that involve multiple joints and muscle groups.
